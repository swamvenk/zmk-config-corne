# ZMK Keymap Config for Wireless Corne
## Preface
### Corne
Corne is a split keyboard layout available in [foostan/crkbd](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). The original designs were for a wired variant of corne. The repo has PCB designs for both MX and Choc switches.
### Wireless Corne
Over the years people have modified the original wired design to build a wireless version of the keyboard. [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz/) has really good options to build one yourself.
### ZMK
The famous [QMK firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware) is only used for wired keyboards. For wireless ones, we use [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) instead.
